# Grond: A Workout App
### AKA Karissa's weekend project.

Grond is a Card-based workout app. It allows you to create workout cards for excercises like push-ups, squats, lunges, etc., and assemble them into decks with additional rules such as the number of reps per exercise or timed intervals. Users will be able to create their own decks and cards or choose from premade decks.
